# Leetcode-Challenges

I will be providing all of the solutions to the problems that I encounter in Leetcode.
This will be a journey and I hope to remain consistent with solving problems every other day.

For now I will be formating all of my solutions into one folder (Easy). 
Later when I get to do medium or hard problems on Leetcode, than I will also include those folders as well.

This is my preparation in order to become a better problem solver that differs from doing projects.
